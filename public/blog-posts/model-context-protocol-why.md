## Introduction

Modern AI applications are only as powerful as the context they operate in. Without the right background information, even the most advanced language models can provide generic or incomplete answers. Developers often end up acting as “context assemblers,” manually stitching together APIs, databases, documents, and workflows just to give the model enough awareness to perform a task effectively. This fragmented approach works—barely—but it doesn’t scale.

Enter the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, a standardized way for AI systems to seamlessly communicate with external tools, applications, and data sources. If function calling was the first step in extending models beyond raw text generation, MCP represents the next evolutionary leap: a framework for building **context-aware, extensible, and maintainable AI systems**.

## The Pre-MCP Era: Where Things Fell Apart

Before MCP, every AI integration was a **custom build**. Imagine three common scenarios:

1. **AI + GitHub Copilot-like system:**
   Suppose you wanted your AI assistant to summarize pull requests in GitHub. You would:

   * Write custom API calls to fetch pull request data.
   * Normalize the data into a prompt-friendly format.
   * Handle authentication (e.g., OAuth tokens) manually.
   * Update your integration whenever GitHub’s API version changed.
     Every new feature—like checking commit history—required another layer of glue code.

2. **AI + Slack for team updates:**
   Let’s say you wanted your chatbot to respond to “What did the team discuss today?”

   * You’d write a Slack bot to export channel history.
   * Pipe that data into your AI model.
   * Maintain rules to trim, chunk, and fit messages into token limits.
   * Reimplement logging and error handling from scratch.
     A slight change in Slack’s APIs could break the workflow.

3. **AI + Notion for knowledge management:**
   To answer “What’s our product roadmap?” the assistant needed to query Notion databases.

   * Developers built brittle JSON-parsing layers.
   * Any schema change in Notion meant fixing broken code.
   * Reusing this code in another project was nearly impossible.

In all these cases, the AI model itself wasn’t the bottleneck—the **integration work** was. Developers became context plumbers, not AI builders.

## The Problem Summarized

* **Humans as the glue:** Developers wrote endless adapters between AI and each tool.
* **Integration friction:** No portability—each new system was a fresh engineering effort.
* **Code maintenance burden:** Integrations broke frequently due to API drift.
* **Fragmented function calling:** Function calling helped, but remained ad hoc and inconsistent across tools.

This “pre-MCP world” made scaling AI assistants across an organization frustrating and costly.

---

## The MCP Shift: Standardization

Now imagine the same scenarios with MCP:

* Instead of hand-rolling GitHub APIs, your AI assistant connects to a **GitHub MCP server** that exposes standardized endpoints for pull requests, commits, or issues.
* For Slack, the MCP server provides context in a uniform way—no more custom export scripts or ad hoc formatting.
* For Notion, the MCP server communicates schema and data consistently, so your assistant always “knows” how to interpret the workspace.

By following a **client–server protocol**, context becomes modular and reusable.

---

## Architecture: How MCP Works

MCP follows a **client–server architecture**, which is both simple and powerful:

* **Client (AI Application):** The “consumer” that requires contextual data (e.g., your AI assistant).
* **Server (Context Provider):** Applications like GitHub, Slack, Notion, or even a custom database that serve context when requested.

Between these, MCP defines the participants:

* **MCP Host:** The control room of the AI application. It manages the MCP client and integrates context into the model’s reasoning.
* **MCP Client:** The component that maintains a connection to the MCP server and fetches context. Think of it as the “bridge” between host and server.
* **MCP Server:** The program that provides structured context from an external system.

One important detail: MCP maintains a **one-to-one relationship between an MCP client and an MCP server**. This makes each integration modular and easier to reason about.

## MCP vs. Function Calling: What’s the Difference?

At first glance, **function calling** and **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** might look similar—they both extend models beyond plain text. But their purpose and scope are quite different.

* **Function Calling:**

  * Introduced as a way for language models to call specific functions defined by developers.
  * Example: The model is asked *“What’s the weather in Berlin?”*. The system has a `getWeather(city)` function, and the model fills the argument `city="Berlin"`.
  * Strength: It gives the model the ability to trigger deterministic actions safely.
  * Limitation: Each integration must be **custom-built and tied to a single app**. If you want Slack, GitHub, and Notion, you need to write three separate adapters.

* **Model Context Protocol (MCP):**

  * Goes beyond single function calls by defining a **standardized protocol** for AI applications to communicate with external systems.
  * Example: Instead of custom Slack code, you connect to a Slack MCP server. The server *already* knows how to provide chat context in a structured way, and your AI assistant simply consumes it.
  * Strength: **Interoperability and modularity.** The same MCP client can talk to many MCP servers (GitHub, Slack, Notion), without rewriting integrations.
  * Limitation: MCP focuses on *context exchange and modular architecture*, not just invoking one-off functions.

### Quick Comparison Table

| Aspect          | Function Calling                    | Model Context Protocol (MCP)             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**       | Single function integration         | Standardized protocol across systems     |
| **Reusability** | Low – each integration custom-built | High – servers can be reused across apps |
| **Focus**       | Triggering actions safely           | Context exchange and modularity          |
| **Maintenance** | High upkeep with API changes        | Lower – standardized, protocol-driven    |
| **Example**     | `getWeather(city)`                  | Slack MCP server providing chat context  |

**In short:**

* Function calling = *“How can a model invoke this specific function?”*
* MCP = *“How can models and external systems communicate through a shared protocol so context and actions are reusable across applications?”*

## Why It Matters

1. **Scalability:** No more reinventing integrations for each application. MCP makes external systems pluggable.
2. **Maintainability:** Protocol-driven design reduces custom glue code and fragile connectors.
3. **Interoperability:** Different tools can speak the same language, making AI applications more portable.
4. **Personalization:** With standardized context, AI assistants become truly customized to a team’s workflows.
5. **Future-Proofing:** By adopting MCP, developers align with the direction in which AI ecosystems are evolving—towards modularity and standardization.

## Conclusion

The **Model Context Protocol** is not just another framework—it’s a foundational shift in how AI systems interact with the broader ecosystem of tools and data. It moves us from a world where developers hack together context pipelines, to one where context is treated as a **first-class citizen** in AI design.

In part two of this series, we’ll go deeper into real-world use cases: how MCP simplifies connecting with systems like GitHub or Slack, and how it turns “context plumbing” into a reusable, standardized protocol.
